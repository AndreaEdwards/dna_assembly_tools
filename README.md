# DNA assembly tools

This is a web app that allows you to print out a set of oligonucleotides for a homology-based DNA assembly reaction such as Circular Polymerization Extension Cyclization (CPEC) or Gibson Assembly.


#### Application details

The application is written in python 2.7 using the tornado webserver, and it *will be* deployed with heroku (changes coming soon).
